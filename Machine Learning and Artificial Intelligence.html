										<center><p style="color: black;">Intelligent assistants like Alexa and Siri, image searches that found the topic of a photo, and self-driving cars â€“ these intelligent systems used machine learning to develop 
											their expertise. In this module, I learned about various machine learning techniques but concentrated on deep neural learning. I learned about the underlying theory and got hands-on experience creating, 
											training, evaluating, and using machine learning systems. I also examined how these technologies were used and misused and what that meant for our societies and communities.</p></center>

											<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">
											<ul style="color: black;">
											<li>Understanding Machine Learning's Social Impacts: I gained an insight into the broader issues surrounding machine learning, including its utilization and societal effects.</li>
											<li>Deep Neural Learning Mastery: I acquired skills in creating, training, and evaluating neural networks for tasks like handwriting recognition, and understood their limitations in scaling to larger problems.</li>
											<li>Proficiency with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): I learned how CNNs identify and combine features in inputs to achieve image classification, enhancing my ability to work with image-based data.</li>
											<li>Competence in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): I developed the ability to use RNNs for time-dependent data analysis, such as language processing, leveraging their capability to retain information for contextual interpretation.</li>
											<li>Autoencoder Applications: I explored autoencoders for data compression, cleaning, and missing data replacement, understanding their role in generating deepfakes and the implications for digital trust.</li>
											<li>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models: I compared deep learning with alternative machine learning approaches, assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and the biases that can arise from data preparation.</li>
											<li>Critical Evaluation of Machine Learning Systems: I learned to critically review the technical aspects of machine learning systems, their applications, and the potential impacts on individuals and society.</li>
