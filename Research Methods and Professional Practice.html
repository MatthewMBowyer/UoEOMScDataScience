											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">
											This e-portfolio captures my full learning experience throughout my latest module. Over twelve units and two major projects, I developed a stronger understanding of 
											how research is planned, executed, and most importantly, communicated in a professional and comprehensible manner. The e-portfolio also pushes me to reflect critically 
											on my own professional development. This is best achieved by following clear guidelines that promote critical reflection. (Satienchayakorn & Sanpatchayapong, 2025)
											</p>
											<p style="color: black;">
											The module was a shift from the process of EDA, graphs, and reporting by adding initial steps of research and planning. This promoted further understanding in the project domain
											and knowledge of the latest research being done on the domain before I even began the EDA. This was emphasized to me as I completed the two major projects—one in a domain I am 
											already familiar with and another in a domain I have yet to explore.
											</p>

												<h2>Reflection Approach: Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">
												Throughout this e-portfolio, and given its success in previous submissions, I have used Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (The University of Edinburgh, 2024)
												as the foundation for reflection. With six stages described below, Gibbs model allows me to reflect deeply and systematically on each unit. This approach keeps me accountable 
												for the work completed in each unit and provides an opportunity to elaborate further on those where more extensive work was undertaken.
												</p>
											<li><b>Description:</b> on the learning experience throughout each unit in the module.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> on my emotional response to initially viewing the units and then feedback on the complete projects.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> of the entire unit, the good and the bad.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> on the units in hindsight.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> on the unit and what I have learned and what I would have done differently.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> on how I would deal with the next unit or module.</li>
												&nbsp;
											<p style="color: black;">
												For the final reflection, I also draw on Rolfe et al.’s (2001) “What? So what? Now what?” framework, which simplifies complex reflection into actionable goals. This dual-model approach 
												is structured but flexible, and it encourages me to connect theory with practice. As Walland and Shaw (2020) argue, e-portfolios are both a process and a product: they’re about how we learn, 
												not just what we produce. Majola (2025) emphasizes similar ideas, using terminology I resonate with — it’s not just a final product but a process of growth. This reflective structure 
												captures that philosophy — showing my messy thinking, emotional responses, growth, and professional application.

												<h2>Reflection on Each Unit</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Unit 1 – Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> This unit introduced the elements of the scientific method and the importance of ethics in research. I explored inductive and deductive reasoning and discussed ethical issues in computing, particularly around dark UX patterns.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I was surprised to score 50 % on the reasoning quiz. A reminder that deduction and induction can be tricky to distinguish. Still, I found the topic fascinating, especially how ethical boundaries shape professional practice.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> The readings helped me understand the foundation of scientific inquiry, but my initial confusion showed I needed to deepen my understanding of logic. The dark-patterns case study also helped me connect theory to real-world ethics.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> The quiz highlighted a clear knowledge gap. Ethics, while often overlooked, forms the backbone of professional credibility — I realised I must not treat it as an afterthought.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Ethics and logical reasoning are the twin pillars of sound research. I now see how they ensure transparency and reliability in computing.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Revisit inductive/deductive reasoning examples weekly until confident; retake the quiz and apply these reasoning types to my projects to reinforce understanding.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Collab discussion 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my collaborative discussion on Ethics</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											
												&nbsp;
											<h3>Unit 2 –Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I learned how to formulate clear, focused, and researchable questions, transforming general ideas into structured proposals.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> At first, developing precise questions felt overwhelming, but the framework provided helped simplify the process.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Early attempts were rough, yet by iterating and reviewing examples, I gained confidence in creating strong, relevant research questions.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Good research begins with good questions, they guide everything from data collection to analysis. This shaped the foundation for my literature review on churn prediction.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Strong, well-crafted questions anchor all research efforts, ensuring purpose and direction.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Practise reframing broad work problems into research-style questions monthly to sharpen precision before my dissertation.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Literature Review Plan.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my literature review plan - Early doors for the unit 7 project</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 3 – Methodology and Research Methods</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> This unit deepened my understanding of exploratory versus descriptive research and introduced qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> The theory felt dense at first, but I appreciated how each approach complements different research objectives.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I recognised the strengths of each method. Quantitative for measurement, qualitative for insight, and how both can merge into richer mixed methods.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> The choice of method must always align with the research question and the type of data sought. This became vital for my churn study, where numerical and behavioural data intersect.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Understanding research design clarified how methodology transforms abstract questions into executable studies.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Before each new analysis, explicitly document whether my approach is exploratory or descriptive and justify my chosen method.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Literature review preperation.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my attempt at researching methods, data collection and skills required for the unit 7 project</b></a></li>

											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 4 – Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I explored practical qualitative data-collection tools like case studies, focus groups, and observation, while submitting my literature-review outline for feedback.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Submitting my outline was nerve-wracking but reassuring; feedback gave me clear direction.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> This stage showed me how different methods produce distinct data types, each revealing unique perspectives.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Balancing depth (qualitative) and scale (quantitative) is key. The feedback process also reinforced that refinement through critique strengthens research quality.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Iterative feedback is essential in refining both focus and scope in research.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Apply peer and tutor feedback loops early in my dissertation process rather than waiting until submission.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Literature review outline.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See the outline for my unit 7 project as well as feedback given</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 5 – Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> This unit focused on designing effective interviews and surveys, understanding sampling, and balancing open-ended and closed-ended questions.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Designing unbiased questions was tougher than expected; it required empathy and precision.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Learning about pre and post-testing made me appreciate how much design impacts data reliability.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Well-crafted instruments can make or break a study’s validity. Surveys require not only statistical care but ethical transparency about anonymity and consent.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Quality data starts with thoughtful, ethical question design.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Create a reusable survey template with ethical disclaimers and balanced question structures for future research tasks.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Data Collection Outline.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my data collection outline for the unit 7 project</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 6 – Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I revisited descriptive statistics, data levels, and measures of spread. Familiar ground as a data scientist.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Comfortable and confident; it felt like home territory.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> While the content was easy, I reflected that computing results isn’t enough as interpretation for the audience is what matters.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Statistical literacy is only impactful when paired with communication skills. Translating numbers into meaning elevates findings.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> EDA and descriptive statistics should always serve storytelling, not just accuracy.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> For every quantitative output at work, include one visual and one plain-language explanation to reinforce comprehension.</li>

											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 7 – Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> This unit explored probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing, the transition from description to inference. I also handed in my unit 7 project.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I felt confident but aware that true rigour demands precise sampling and data collection. The unit 7 project was my first marked Literature Review (LR), i was nervous.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> It reinforced the relationship between data quality and inference reliability. Poor sampling leads to misleading results, no matter the test.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Hypothesis testing reminded me that research is about evidence, not proof. In data science, this mindset curbs over-confidence in models. 72% for the LR, very happy with that result.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Inferential statistics ground predictions in evidence, promoting disciplined interpretation. I could have gone into more depth in the LR by using more acadmeic papers</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Apply formal hypothesis framing in my next predictive-model project before drawing conclusions. Find further acadmeic papers for projects to promote depth.</li>

											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 8 – Data Analysis and Visualisation</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> The unit discussed analysis and presentation techniques for qualitative and quantitative results, with a focus on dashboards and storytelling.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I enjoyed this section, it aligned perfectly with my professional skills and interest in data storytelling.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I realised that visualisation in academic research demands clarity and context, not just aesthetic dashboards.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Good visuals bridge understanding between technical and non-technical audiences, something I practise daily at work.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Effective visualisation is equal parts communication and ethics, data must never mislead.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Adopt a “clarity-first” design rule for all future dashboards and research figures.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Research Proposal Presentation Outline.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my research proposa outline for the unit 10 project</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 9 – Validity and Generalisability in Research</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I studied validity, reliability, and threats such as bias and confounding. I also completed a statistical-charts activity in Excel.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> The theory was intriguing but repetitive; I wanted to ensure I truly grasped its real-world implications.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Understanding validity refined my approach to evaluating data sources and methodology credibility.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Reliability ensures consistency, while validity ensures truth. Both are non-negotiable in any research claiming credibility.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Quality research stands on rigorous validity checks and transparent methodology.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Build a validity checklist to review all analyses and future academic projects.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Charts Worksheet.xlsx" target="_blank"><b>See my work on charts in excel</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 10 – Research Writing</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> This unit guided me through structuring a dissertation and preparing for research reporting. I delivered my presentation on predicting Formula 1 qualifying order and race outcomes.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Initially nervous, I ended up enjoying it. Merging my professional and personal passion for F1.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Conducting extensive literature review taught me how depth creates credibility. I found gaps where F1 analytics remains under-researched.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Research writing is persuasion: clarity, evidence, and coherence convince readers more than jargon. I acheived 74% on the research proposal.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Strong research writing turns analysis into impact; it communicates rather than intimidates. Though, i can improve on key sections like methodology based on feedback on my research proposal</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Before my dissertation, practise summarising complex results into one-page executive briefs to sharpen clarity. Emphasize on key sections during practise.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/F1 Masters presentation.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my presentation on the research proposal</b></a></li>
											<li><a href="assets/Research Proposal Presentation Transcript.pdf" target="_blank"><b>See my research proposal presentation transcript</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 11 – Going Forward: Professional Development and Your e-Portfolio</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Focused on reflective practice, professional skills, and constructing the e-portfolio narrative.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I appreciated the chance to consolidate learning and assess progress through the Professional Skills Matrix.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I could trace clear growth — stronger analysis, ethics awareness, and storytelling — compared with earlier modules.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Reflection has become a habit, not an assignment. Regular self-review is now part of how I work professionally.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Continuous reflection transforms experience into expertise.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Schedule quarterly professional reflections tied to KPIs to maintain ongoing growth.</li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 12 – Project Management and Managing Risk</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> The final unit introduced project-management principles, risk identification, and change-management strategies. As well as the e portfolio deadline.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> It was a satisfying conclusion, both practical and relevant to both work and research. Excited for feedback on my e portfolio.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Understanding risk reinforced how uncertainty must be managed proactively, especially in long-term research projects.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Risk management in research parallels data-science production: identify dependencies early, plan contingencies, and communicate transparently.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Effective project management balances structure with adaptability — essential for complex, data-driven studies.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Develop a standard risk-register template for my dissertation and personal analytics projects.</li>

												<h2>Reflection Piece</h2>
													&nbsp;
											</header>
									
											<h4 style="color: black;">What? — My Learning Journey</h4>
												<p style="color: black;">
													Over twelve units, I learned to slow down and think like a researcher rather than just a data scientist. Research is not only about producing results but also about understanding and justifying every 
													step that leads there. My Cartrack literature review taught me how to synthesise complex sources and identify academic gaps. My Formula 1 proposal allowed me to design a research process from start to 
													finish, combining methodology, ethics, and storytelling.
												</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
													Each unit contributed a distinct layer of competence. The early units built my foundation in ethics and reasoning. Mid-module, I developed methodological fluency and statistical awareness. 
													The final units shifted my attention to professional reflection, project management, and risk mitigation. Together, they formed a comprehensive journey from curiosity to execution,
													and now, evaluation.
												</p>
													<h4 style="color: black;">So What? — Growth, Emotions, and Turning Points</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">
													Emotionally, this module was different. It was slower and more reflective than the technical modules I’m used to. That initially frustrated me. I wanted to “do” rather than “think.” 
													But reflection revealed that strong research starts with thinking.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
													The first turning point was in Unit 1-3, where the ethics discussion on dark UX patterns connected academic principles with my daily professional reality. 
														It reminded me that even subtle design decisions can have ethical consequences.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The second turning point came during Unit 5, when I designed a questionnaire and realised how delicate wording can influence data integrity. It changed the way I interpret survey 
														results; no question is neutral.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The third was Unit 7, submitting my first full literature review and receiving 72% (Which 70%+ is distinction). It was validation and direction in one. My tutor’s comments on adding 
														academic depth pushed me to seek more peer-reviewed evidence and not rely solely on technical white papers.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														Finally, Unit 10 reignited my love of applied analytics through the Formula 1 project. Translating data-driven predictions into a structured academic proposal was exciting, 
														humbling, and satisfying — especially achieving 74%. Though it was all theory, it sparked drive for the thesis i will complete in the next module.
														
													</p>
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														Beyond content, the module improved how I think:
														
													</p>
													<ul>
  													<li><b>Criticality:</b> I now question assumptions and test logic before coding or analysing.</li>
 													<li><b>Ethics:</b> I include a short “ethical risk” note in my scripts to flag potential biases.</li>
  													<li><b>Communication:</b> I practice explaining models in plain language, anticipating the reader’s background.</li>
													<li><b>Resilience:</b> Balancing workload, study, and research taught me to plan smarter, not longer.</li>
													</ul>
													<h4 style="color: black;">Now What? — Applying the Learning</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The skills and awareness gained will directly feed into my dissertation and my professional practice.
													</p>
													<ul>
  													<li><b>1. Integrating Academic Rigor into Work:</b> I will embed research design principles into every project. Defining questions, identifying variables, and selecting methods before writing any code. 
														This ensures each project can stand academic scrutiny.</li>
														
  													<li><b>2. Ethical & Professional Conduct:</b> Inspired by Satienchayakorn and Sanpatchayapong (2025), I’ll advocate for structured reflection within our analytics team. 
														Introducing guided prompts during project reviews could promote ethical awareness and accountability.</li>
														
  													<li><b>3. Enhanced Communication:</b> My goal is to create concise, stakeholder-friendly summaries for every technical project, explaining why choices were made. This aligns with Rolfe et al.’s emphasis 
														on action-oriented reflection.</li>
														
													<li><b>4. Research Continuity:</b> The Formula 1 proposal opened a curiosity about predictive modelling in sport. I plan to explore publishing a small paper comparing sport prediction models 
														versus telematics forecasting models.</li>
														
													<li><b>5. Personal Growth:</b> Reflection has helped me manage imposter syndrome. By documenting progress, I can see growth in real terms rather than relying on memory or emotion. Being relatively 
													early in my career, imposter syndrom plays a large factor in projects, goals and growth.</li>
													</ul>
													<p style="color: black;">
														In short, this module taught me how to think like a researcher, act ethically like a professional, and communicate like a leader. It bridged academia and practice in a way that will
														influence my dissertation and my long-term career trajectory.

													<h4 style="color: black;">Conclusion</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">This module has been transformative. I began it expecting a theory-heavy hurdle but leave it with practical, transferable frameworks that shape everything I do. 
														My understanding of ethics, validity, and research design has deepened, my confidence in writing and presentation has grown, and reflection has become a habit rather than an academic 
														exercise.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">Both my Cartrack literature review and Formula 1 proposal show how research methods extend beyond academia — they make industry work more disciplined, ethical, and 
														impactful. This e-portfolio captures that evolution: from practitioner to reflective professional, from coder to researcher.</p>
