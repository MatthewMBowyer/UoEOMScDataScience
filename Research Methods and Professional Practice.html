											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">
											This e-portfolio captures my learning across twelve units and two major projects, strengthening my understanding of how research is planned, executed, and communicated professionally. It also encourages 
											critical reflection on my development (Satienchayakorn & Sanpatchayapong, 2025). 
											</p>

												<h2>Reflection Approach: Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">
												I used Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (The University of Edinburgh, 2024) as my reflection framework. It allows deep, systematic reflection on each unit and accountability for completed work.
												This approach keeps me accountable for the work completed in each unit and provides an opportunity to elaborate further on those where more extensive work was undertaken.
												</p>
											
											<p style="color: black;">
												For the reflection, I also applied Rolfe et al.’s (2001) “What? So what? Now what?” model, linking theory to practice. As Walland and Shaw (2020) and Majola (2025) note, e-portfolios are 
												both process and product, capturing growth, reflection, and professional application. Majola (2025) emphasizes similar ideas saying it’s not just a final product 
												but a process of growth.

												<h2>Reflection Piece</h2>
													&nbsp;
											</header>
									
											<h4 style="color: black;">What? — My Learning Journey</h4>
												<p style="color: black;">
													Over twelve units, I learned to slow down and think like a researcher rather than just a data scientist. Research is not only about producing results but also about understanding and justifying every 
													step that leads there. My Cartrack literature review taught me how to synthesise complex sources and identify academic gaps. My Formula 1 proposal allowed me to design a research process from start to 
													finish, combining methodology, ethics, and storytelling.
												</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
													Each unit contributed a distinct layer of competence. The early units built my foundation in ethics and reasoning. Mid-module, I developed methodological fluency and statistical awareness. 
													The final units shifted my attention to professional reflection, project management, and risk mitigation. Together, they formed a comprehensive journey from curiosity to execution,
													and now, evaluation.
												</p>
													<h4 style="color: black;">So What? — Growth, Emotions, and Turning Points</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">
													Emotionally, this module was different. It was slower and more reflective than the technical modules I’m used to. That initially frustrated me. I wanted to “do” rather than “think.” 
													But reflection revealed that strong research starts with thinking.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
													The first turning point was in Unit 1-3, where the ethics discussion on dark UX patterns connected academic principles with my daily professional reality. 
														It reminded me that even subtle design decisions can have ethical consequences.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The second turning point came during Unit 5, when I designed a questionnaire and realised how delicate wording can influence data integrity. It changed the way I interpret survey 
														results; no question is neutral.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The third was Unit 7, submitting my first full literature review and receiving 72% (Which 70%+ is distinction). It was validation and direction in one. My tutor’s comments on adding 
														academic depth pushed me to seek more peer-reviewed evidence and not rely solely on technical white papers.
														
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														Finally, Unit 10 reignited my love of applied analytics through the Formula 1 project. Translating data-driven predictions into a structured academic proposal was exciting, 
														humbling, and satisfying — especially achieving 74%. Though it was all theory, it sparked drive for the thesis i will complete in the next module.
														
													</p>
													</p>
													<p style="color: black;">
														Beyond content, the module improved how I think:
														
													</p>
													<ul>
  													<li><b>Criticality:</b> I now question assumptions and test logic before coding or analysing.</li>
 													<li><b>Ethics:</b> I include a short “ethical risk” note in my scripts to flag potential biases.</li>
  													<li><b>Communication:</b> I practice explaining models in plain language, anticipating the reader’s background.</li>
													<li><b>Resilience:</b> Balancing workload, study, and research taught me to plan smarter, not longer.</li>
													</ul>
													<h4 style="color: black;">Now What? — Applying the Learning</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">
														The skills and awareness gained will directly feed into my dissertation and my professional practice.
													</p>
													<ul>
  													<li><b>1. Integrating Academic Rigor into Work:</b> I will embed research design principles into every project. Defining questions, identifying variables, and selecting methods before writing any code. 
														This ensures each project can stand academic scrutiny.</li>
														
  													<li><b>2. Ethical & Professional Conduct:</b> Inspired by Satienchayakorn and Sanpatchayapong (2025), I’ll advocate for structured reflection within our analytics team. 
														Introducing guided prompts during project reviews could promote ethical awareness and accountability.</li>
														
  													<li><b>3. Enhanced Communication:</b> My goal is to create concise, stakeholder-friendly summaries for every technical project, explaining why choices were made. This aligns with Rolfe et al.’s emphasis 
														on action-oriented reflection.</li>
														
													<li><b>4. Research Continuity:</b> The Formula 1 proposal opened a curiosity about predictive modelling in sport. I plan to explore publishing a small paper comparing sport prediction models 
														versus telematics forecasting models.</li>
														
													<li><b>5. Personal Growth:</b> Reflection has helped me manage imposter syndrome. By documenting progress, I can see growth in real terms rather than relying on memory or emotion. Being relatively 
													early in my career, imposter syndrome plays a large factor in projects, goals and growth.</li>
													</ul>
													<p style="color: black;">
														In short, this module taught me how to think like a researcher, act ethically like a professional, and communicate like a leader. It bridged academia and practice in a way that will
														influence my dissertation and my long-term career trajectory.

													<h4 style="color: black;">Conclusion</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">This module has been transformative. I began it expecting a theory-heavy hurdle but leave it with practical, transferable frameworks that shape everything I do. 
														My understanding of ethics, validity, and research design has deepened, my confidence in writing and presentation has grown, and reflection has become a habit rather than an academic 
														exercise.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">Both my Cartrack literature review and Formula 1 proposal show how research methods extend beyond academia — they make industry work more disciplined, ethical, and 
														impactful. This e-portfolio captures that evolution: from practitioner to reflective professional, from coder to researcher.</p>
