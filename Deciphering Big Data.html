												<ul style="color: black;">
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 1-3 Collaborative Discussion 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary:</b></a> In this project, I critically evaluated the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IoT) in the context of the article by Huxley et al. (2020), highlighting the opportunities, risks, and challenges associated with large-scale data collection. I also explored the importance of data wrangling in managing IoT-generated big data.</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">My initial post was praised for highlighting how IoT contributes to predictive analytics in fleet management, particularly in sectors like transportation. Peer feedback focused on the challenges of managing IoT data, emphasizing the need for advanced architectures like Lambda and Kappa. This feedback helped me refine my approach to discussing security and data validation concerns in IoT integration.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="" target=""><b>Mathematics Test Summary:</b></a> A test on Python concepts, librarys and practices. Although I scored 94%, I realized that some terminologies were unfamiliar to me, signaling the importance of continuous learning beyond my current work experience.</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">The high score reaffirmed my technical abilities, but my reflection emphasized the need to stay updated on modern terminologies. I now make an effort to keep learning beyond my day-to-day role by engaging with industry trends and participating in professional development courses.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 6 - Project Report Database Design for Ride-Hailing Company.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Team Project Summary:</b></a>This group project involved designing a logical database for a ride-hailing company. I contributed to the database build proposal, focusing on key aspects such as scalability, data cleaning, and security. I used PostgreSQL as the DBMS and designed a data management pipeline to process large volumes of trip data. </li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">The feedback indicated that while the report demonstrated good knowledge of database design, it lacked critical evaluation, particularly in comparing alternative systems. We were encouraged to enhance our referencing and ensure that every recommendation was backed by a well-reasoned analysis. The team was disappointed by the grade of 62%, but we learned the importance of critical evaluation.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 - Individual Project Executive Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Individual Executive Summary:</b></a>This project involved summarizing the work from Unit 6. I incorporated feedback by improving the critical analysis of the pros and cons of SQL vs NoSQL databases, focusing on MongoDB for its flexibility in handling unstructured data. I also integrated GDPR compliance measures into the database design. </li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">Though I haven't received formal feedback yet, I believe the improvements I made to the integrity of the project, especially regarding critical evaluation and increased referencing have significantly enhanced the final report.</p>

												<h2>Reflections and Meeting Notes</h2>
											</header>
												<p style="color: black;">
												Click bold text to open up project
												
												<ul style="color: black;">
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 1-3 Collaborative Discussion 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 1:</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This project focused on analyzing the role of IoT in big data systems. I explored the opportunities for real-time decision-making in transportation, while also addressing the risks of security breaches and data complexity.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">The project taught me to balance technical expertise with an understanding of broader risks and opportunities. The feedback highlighted gaps in my discussion around security, which I now recognize as a critical aspect in the IoT context. My peers' input on data validation and processing architectures broadened my perspective, helping me improve my analysis.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">Moving forward, I will integrate stronger security considerations into my work, particularly as we deal with IoT data for fleet management. I have started researching advanced data processing architectures like Lambda to handle the high volumes of IoT data more effectively.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="" target=""><b>Mathematics Test:</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This test assessed my ability to apply Python methodologies for data wrangling. While I achieved a high score, I discovered that I lacked familiarity with certain modern terminologies.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This experience underscored the importance of staying up-to-date with industry terminology and techniques. Although I have significant professional experience, I learned that continuous education is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in data science.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">I have since committed to ongoing learning, through my Masters and podcasts like Super Data Science to ensure i remain current with emerging trends and terminologies. </p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 6 - Project Report Database Design for Ride-Hailing Company.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Team Project:</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">I contributed to the design of a scalable database for a ride-hailing company, focusing on the logical structure and data pipeline. However, the project lacked depth in critical evaluation, particularly in comparing SQL and NoSQL systems.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">I realized the importance of providing a thorough critical analysis when recommending a system. The feedback emphasized that without comparing the pros and cons of each system, we missed an opportunity to present a balanced view to the client. The need for improved referencing also became clear.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">I applied this lesson in Unit 11, ensuring that my executive summary included a more detailed comparison of SQL and NoSQL systems, supported by academic references. This approach helped me strengthen the overall quality of the report, and I am confident that the improved critical analysis will lead to a better result.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 - Individual Project Executive Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Individual Executive:</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This project allowed me to apply the feedback from Unit 6. I focused on improving the critical evaluation of the database management system and addressed GDPR compliance more thoroughly.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This project was a turning point in applying critical thinking to my work. I gained a deeper understanding of how to balance flexibility (NoSQL) with reliability (SQL), and the importance of compliance in database design.</p>
													&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">I feel more confident in critcally evaluating technologies and plan to apply these skills in my professional roles. When developing new projects and getting coworked to stakeholders involved, i will focus more on the integrity of what i present. This can be done using strong references, understanding what i am saying and most importantly, asking more knowledgable peers like in the unit 6 project that was incorporated into this project.</p>
													&nbsp;
													&nbsp;
												<p style="color: black;">
												Throughout this module, I have developed a strong understanding of data wrangling, database design, and critical evaluation techniques. The projects have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, improving my technical and critical thinking skills. I now recognize the importance of continuously updating my skills to stay relevant in the fast-evolving field of data science. Teamwork in a virtual environment was also a key learning point, and I have become more adept at balancing individual contributions with collaborative efforts.
