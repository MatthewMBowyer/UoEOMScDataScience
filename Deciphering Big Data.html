												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This project focused on analyzing the role of IoT in big data systems. I explored the opportunities for real-time decision-making in transportation, while also addressing the risks of security breaches and data complexity.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">The project taught me to balance technical expertise with an understanding of broader risks and opportunities. The feedback highlighted gaps in my discussion around security, which I now recognize as a critical aspect in the IoT context. My peers' input on data validation and processing architectures broadened my perspective, helping me improve my analysis.</p>
													
													<p style="color: black;">Moving forward, I will integrate stronger security considerations into my work, particularly as we deal with IoT data for fleet management. I have started researching advanced data processing architectures like Lambda to handle the high volumes of IoT data more effectively.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><b>Mathematics Test:</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">This test assessed my ability to apply Python methodologies for data wrangling. While I achieved a high score, I discovered that I lacked familiarity with certain modern terminologies.</p>
													
													<p style="color: black;">This experience underscored the importance of staying up-to-date with industry terminology and techniques.
