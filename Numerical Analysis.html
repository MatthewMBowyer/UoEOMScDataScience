										<center><p style="color: black;"> This module introduces key aspects of mathematics and statistics for data science and artificial intelligence. The central consideration of this module is the need to be aware of, and 
											be able to critically evaluate, the range of mathematical and statistical methodology seen in both disciplines, and to build a foundation for analysing and solving problems in both disciplines.</p></center>

											<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">I will be able to:</p>
											<p style="color: black;">
											<ul style="color: black;">
											<li>Systematic understanding of the key mathematical and statistical concepts and techniques which underpin mechanisms in Data Science and AI.</li>
											<li>Apply mathematical and statistical methods in these fields to help in the decision-making process.</li>
											<li>Critically evaluate the use of statistical analysis and the numeric interpretation of results as aids in the decision-making process.</li>

												<h2>Reflections and Meeting Notes</h2>

												<p style="color: black;">

												<ul style="color: black;">
												<li><a href="assets/Collab Disc 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary:</b></a> Throughout this project on the convergence of data science, AI, and cybersecurity, I gained comprehensive 
													insights into the evolving landscape of technology and its implications. My learning journey was structured around analyzing various scholarly articles, synthesizing opinions, and engaging in discussions 
													with peers. This process enlightened me on the multifaceted roles of data as the cornerstone of technological advancement and the ethical considerations inherent in its manipulation.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Professional - Collaborative Discussion 2.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 2 Summary:</b></a> In my final post, I incorporated the feedback by providing more detailed 
													examples and additional references. I agreed with peers that confidentiality and consent can be achieved online with proper measures and elaborated on how MDM and quality training can enhance the IT Code of 
													Conduct. I also emphasized the role of feedback in improving business practices, citing Meyer-Kalos et al. (2024) and Gussek et al. (2024) on the benefits of client feedback.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The data Prof - Data Analytics Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Data Analytics Report:</b></a> I was puzzled by the need for more charts as this was an initial report before the analysis, i felt focusing on my SQL database and understanding the problem was the main focus. 
														Though, after reflection, it makes sense to do basic analysis at this stage. Overall, the effort was satisfactory but could benefit from deeper analysis and better data representation with use of graphs.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Prof - EOMA.pdf" target="_blank"><b>End of Module Assignment - Data Analytics Implementation:</b></a> The feedback highlighted areas where my work met expectations and areas needing 
													improvement. I demonstrated a satisfactory understanding of the context but failed to integrate sufficient references, weakening the connection between my analysis and implementation. The presentation was 
													acceptable, but the limited use of references affected the overall quality. I was suprised by this due to several references being used in my report. Though i can see where i need to use more references in my 
													analysis adn conclusion to potentially streghten it. This was humbling as i felt my project was done well and grew from my data analytics report, but all i can do is improve and push to not make the same mistake in the remainder of the masters</li>
