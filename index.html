											<h2>About me</h2>
											<h6>Qui ne tente rien n'a rien</h6>
										</header>
										<p style="color: black;">
											Welcome to my professional e-portfolio. I am a dedicated Data Science professional currently enhancing my expertise with a Master's in Data Science from the University of Essex Online. 
											With a foundational BSc (Hons) in Data Science from The Open University UK, my journey in this field is marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge and the application of advanced analytics, machine 
											learning, and data management to drive strategic decisions and operational excellence. Beyond my academic endeavors, I have applied my skills in dynamic roles ranging from Data Analyst at 
											Cartrack to Data Scientist at Greendoor Group, addressing analytical challenges across various sectors and contributing to data-driven growth and efficiency.
										</p>
										<p style="color: black;">
											My career is a testament to the power of data in transforming businesses and operations. At Greendoor Group, I played a pivotal role in analytical projects spanning fleet operations to 
											executive insights, while at Smith Yong and Associates, my focus was on leveraging data for in-depth auditing processes. These experiences underscore my belief in the synergy of scientific 
											methods and cohesive teamwork in unlocking the transformative potential of data.

												<h2>Myself in 10 years</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">
												Looking ahead to the next decade, I envision myself at the intersection of data science and sports, driving innovation with big data and artificial intelligence to tackle global challenges and enhance 
												the world of sports. My journey is uniquely aligned with the dynamic field of Formula 1—a realm where precision, speed, efficiency and data analysis converge to redefine the limits of automotive engineering 
												and racing strategy. This passion is reflected in my dedication to volunteering in sports like Lifesaving and then Olympic Weightlifting for the South African Weightlifting Association, laying the groundwork 
												for my transition into the high-octane world of racing organizations.
											</p>

											<p style="color: black;">	
												With a robust foundation in analytics and machine learning, I aspire to emerge as a pioneering force, introducing groundbreaking research and methodologies that influence not just the sports 
												industry but also the broader field of data science. My ambition extends beyond the racetrack; it encompasses a commitment to lifelong learning, continuously advancing my expertise to stay at 
												the forefront of technological innovation.
											</p>

											<p style="color: black;">	
												In my professional journey, I seek to occupy a leadership role that transcends traditional boundaries, mentoring the next generation of data scientists and instilling in them a nuanced 
												understanding of our discipline's potential to transform sports and, by extension, make a significant, positive impact on society and the environment. Whether it’s optimizing team strategies, 
												improving vehicle performance, or enhancing fan engagement, my ultimate goal is to leverage data not just to win races but to inspire change, promote sustainability, and enrich lives across the globe.
