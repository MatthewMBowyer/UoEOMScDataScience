										<center><p style="color: black;">The module explores and investigates the critical theoretical concepts in the discipline of data science, starting from data collection and 
											then gradually leading to the stage where data is transformed into knowledge to support business decisions. This involves equipping me with 
											the practical skills required to be able to analyse data sets, design and implement a solution using suitable programming languages, such as Python. 
											The module is designed not only to equip me with an understanding of concepts and key knowledge, but also to make me aware 
											of the ethical and professional responsibilities of the data science professional. The module introduces the historical, architectural and practical 
											perspectives of the computer science discipline, and also enables me to engage with, experience and envision the current, as well as future, 
											developments in data science.</p></center>

											<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">I will be able to:</p>
											<p style="color: black;">
											<ul style="color: black;">
											<li>Demonstrate a critical awareness of roles and responsibilities (legal, ethical, social and professional) of a Data Science professional </li>
											<li>Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets</li>
											<li>Distinguish between and critically reflect on the solutions of various data analytics approaches which support business decision making process </li>
											<li>Apply and evaluate critically the various methods, tools, technologies and success factors applied to a data science project in order to develop an effective plan and delivery of solutions to a business problem</li>

												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">While the feedback i received applauds my analytical depth and engagement, it also points towards areas needing further exploration, particularly in addressing and offering solutions to identified challenges. To enhance my project, next time i will consider incorporating
													a deeper exploration of data handling challenges, including bias and anomaly detection, with potential solutions or mitigation strategies, 
													a discussion on industry standards in data science for cybersecurity and how to address the lack of such standards and
													consideration of privacy challenges in IoT and how these can be balanced against global anomaly detection needs.</p>
