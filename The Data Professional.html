										<center><p style="color: black;">The module explores and investigates the critical theoretical concepts in the discipline of data science, starting from data collection and 
											then gradually leading to the stage where data is transformed into knowledge to support business decisions. This involves equipping me with 
											the practical skills required to be able to analyse data sets, design and implement a solution using suitable programming languages, such as Python. 
											The module is designed not only to equip me with an understanding of concepts and key knowledge, but also to make me aware 
											of the ethical and professional responsibilities of the data science professional. The module introduces the historical, architectural and practical 
											perspectives of the computer science discipline, and also enables me to engage with, experience and envision the current, as well as future, 
											developments in data science.</p></center>

											<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">I will be able to:</p>
											<p style="color: black;">
											<ul style="color: black;">
											<li>Demonstrate a critical awareness of roles and responsibilities (legal, ethical, social and professional) of a Data Science professional </li>
											<li>Critically analyse architecture, design, development methodology, querying and the lifecycle of managing large-scale datasets</li>
											<li>Distinguish between and critically reflect on the solutions of various data analytics approaches which support business decision making process </li>
											<li>Apply and evaluate critically the various methods, tools, technologies and success factors applied to a data science project in order to develop an effective plan and delivery of solutions to a business problem</li>

												<h2>Artefacts and Feedback</h2>

												<ul style="color: black;">
												<li><a href="assets/Collab Disc 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary:</b></a> Discussion on the emergence of data science as a subject area, data as the main driver and engine for data science, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity while highlighting the opportunities, limitations, and challenges.</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">While the feedback i received applauds my analytical depth and engagement, it also points towards areas needing further exploration, particularly in addressing and offering solutions to identified challenges. To enhance my project, next time i will consider incorporating
													a deeper exploration of data handling challenges, including bias and anomaly detection, with potential solutions or mitigation strategies, 
													a discussion on industry standards in data science for cybersecurity and how to address the lack of such standards and
													consideration of privacy challenges in IoT and how these can be balanced against global anomaly detection needs.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Professional - Collaborative Discussion 2.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 2 Summary:</b></a> Review your (or an) organisationâ€™s IT Code of Conduct.</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;">Reflecting on the feedback received, I realized the importance of clarity and depth in discussing complex topics. The feedback helped me refine my arguments and provided new 
														perspectives on how to address online confidentiality and consent issues. This process highlighted the value of peer contributions in enhancing understanding and improving professional practices.</p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The data Prof - Data Analytics Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Data Analytics Report:</b></a> Analyzing the 2013-14 National Survey for Wales</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;"> The report demonstrated a solid understanding of the transportation system in Wales and identified relevant datasets. The organization and presentation of the report were 
														clear and structured. There was a need for more detailed analysis of the dataset and modeling of data requirements. The report could have included more charts and graphs to highlight patterns and 
														correlations within the data.  </p>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Prof - EOMA.pdf" target="_blank"><b>End of Module Assignment - Data Analytics Implementation:</b></a> Undertake the analysis according to your chosen UML design using Python libraries to map up your UML implementation</li>
												&nbsp;
													<p style="color: black;"> The work is deemed unsatisfactory due to poor referencing and a weak connection between the analysis and implementation reports. More references are needed to support the research and enhance the credibility of the work.  </p>

												<h2>Reflections and Meeting Notes</h2>
											</header>
												<p style="color: black;">
												Click bold text to open up project
												
												<ul style="color: black;">
												<li><a href="assets/Collab Disc 1.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary:</b></a> Throughout this project on the convergence of data science, AI, and cybersecurity, I gained comprehensive 
													insights into the evolving landscape of technology and its implications. My learning journey was structured around analyzing various scholarly articles, synthesizing opinions, and engaging in discussions 
													with peers. This process enlightened me on the multifaceted roles of data as the cornerstone of technological advancement and the ethical considerations inherent in its manipulation.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Professional - Collaborative Discussion 2.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Collaborative Discussion 2 Summary:</b></a> In my final post, I incorporated the feedback by providing more detailed 
													examples and additional references. I agreed with peers that confidentiality and consent can be achieved online with proper measures and elaborated on how MDM and quality training can enhance the IT Code of 
													Conduct. I also emphasized the role of feedback in improving business practices, citing Meyer-Kalos et al. (2024) and Gussek et al. (2024) on the benefits of client feedback.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The data Prof - Data Analytics Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Data Analytics Report:</b></a> I was puzzled by the need for more charts as this was an initial report before the analysis, i felt focusing on my SQL database and understanding the problem was the main focus. 
														Though, after reflection, it makes sense to do basic analysis at this stage. Overall, the effort was satisfactory but could benefit from deeper analysis and better data representation with use of graphs.</li>
													&nbsp;
												<li><a href="assets/The Data Prof - EOMA.pdf" target="_blank"><b>End of Module Assignment - Data Analytics Implementation:</b></a> The feedback highlighted areas where my work met expectations and areas needing 
													improvement. I demonstrated a satisfactory understanding of the context but failed to integrate sufficient references, weakening the connection between my analysis and implementation. The presentation was 
													acceptable, but the limited use of references affected the overall quality. I was suprised by this due to several references being used in my report. Though i can see where i need to use more references in my 
													analysis adn conclusion to potentially streghten it. This was humbling as i felt my project was done well and grew from my data analytics report, but all i can do is improve and push to not make the same mistake in the remainder of the masters</li>
