										<p style="color: black;">The module explores and investigates the critical theoretical concepts in the discipline of data science, starting from data collection and 
											then gradually leading to the stage where data is transformed into knowledge to support business decisions. This involves equipping me with 
											the practical skills required to be able to analyse data sets, design and implement a solution using suitable programming languages, such as Python. 
											The module is designed not only to equip me with an understanding of concepts and key knowledge, but also to make me aware 
											of the ethical and professional responsibilities of the data science professional. The module introduces the historical, architectural and practical 
											perspectives of the computer science discipline, and also enables me to engage with, experience and envision the current, as well as future, 
											developments in data science.</p>

												<h2>Reflections</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">
												Looking ahead to the next decade, I envision myself at the intersection of data science and sports, driving innovation with big data and artificial intelligence to tackle global challenges and enhance 
												the world of sports. My journey is uniquely aligned with the dynamic field of Formula 1—a realm where precision, speed, efficiency and data analysis converge to redefine the limits of automotive engineering 
												and racing strategy. This passion is reflected in my dedication to volunteering in sports like Lifesaving and then Olympic Weightlifting for the South African Weightlifting Association, laying the groundwork 
												for my transition into the high-octane world of racing organizations.
											</p>

											<p style="color: black;">	
												With a robust foundation in analytics and machine learning, I aspire to emerge as a pioneering force, introducing groundbreaking research and methodologies that influence not just the sports 
												industry but also the broader field of data science. My ambition extends beyond the racetrack; it encompasses a commitment to lifelong learning, continuously advancing my expertise to stay at 
												the forefront of technological innovation.
											</p>

											<p style="color: black;">	
												In my professional journey, I seek to occupy a leadership role that transcends traditional boundaries, mentoring the next generation of data scientists and instilling in them a nuanced 
												understanding of our discipline's potential to transform sports and, by extension, make a significant, positive impact on society and the environment. Whether it’s optimizing team strategies, 
												improving vehicle performance, or enhancing fan engagement, my ultimate goal is to leverage data not just to win races but to inspire change, promote sustainability, and enrich lives across the globe.
