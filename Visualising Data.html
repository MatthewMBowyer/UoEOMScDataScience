											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">My e-portfolio stories my learning journey throughout the Data Visualization module of my MSc in Data Science with the university of 
												Essex online. My e-portfolio is structured to highlight key learning experiences, professional growth, and reflective practices. By fololowing Gibbs’ 
												Reflective Cycle (The University of Edinburgh, 2024) throughout for deeper analysis, I document the steps I have taken to achieve the module’s learning
												outcomes and demonstrate my professional growth.</p>
											<p style="color: black;">In crafting this e-portfolio, I have engaged with Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle and academic papers to analyse my progression and identify 
												areas of improvement. This aligns with the stance that a well-designed e-portfolio can serve as both a process and product of my academic journey 
												(Walland & Shaw, 2020). By reflecting on practical tasks, feedback from peers and lecturers, and my own thought processes, I have been able to refine 
												my technical proficiency, research skills, communication, leadership qualities, and personal resilience.</p>

												<h2>Reflection Approach: Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">I have adopted Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle as the basis for my critical reflection. The cycle involves six key steps:</p>
											<li><b>Description:</b> on the learning experience throughout each unit in the module.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> on my emotional response to initially viewing the units and then feedback on the complete projects.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> of the entire unit, the good and the bad.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> on the units in hindsight.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> on the unit and what I have learned and what I would have done differently.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> on how I would deal with the next unit or module.</li>
												&nbsp;
											<p style="color: black;">Gibbs reflective cycle allows me to grow and learn actively throughout the module. By following the reflective cycle after 
												every unit, I have the opportunity to look back at what I wrote all those weeks ago to come up with a stronger action plan on the entirety of 
												the module.</p>

												<h2>Reflection on Each Unit</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Unit 1: Foundations of Data Visualization</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> The opening unit introduced basic visualization principles. With a case study on reading a complex visual displaying U.S. companies tax rates.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I was enthusiastic, as the topic directly intersects with my background and role as a Data Science.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Positive: The unit was quick and a good refresher into visualization. Negative: I was very quickly humbled by the complex visuals shown, like the visual displaying U.S. companies tax rates. I have a lot to learn about the potential on visualisation.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> I have a lot I need to learn but the opportunity to do so. The new work is not difficult as of yet and so I need to take my time and grasp what I can.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion: </b> The unit was quick and interesting. I have learnt the limitlessness of visualisation. Next time I will come in with an open mind, not be so rigid in thinking I know all that can be done.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan: </b> From the next unit. I will grasp all I can and focus on learning new tricks. Taking down notes and preparing for the first projects.</li>

												&nbsp;
											<h3>Unit 2: Website Comparison (Ryanair vs. EasyJet)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I was tasked with reviewing and critiquing the user experience of two commercial airline websites (Ryanair and EasyJet). I produced an initial post assessing the attributes, types of tasks viewers would undertake, how the data is represented, colour schema used, limitations and strengths and my personal views.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I found this exercise engaging, as it combined user experience design with data storytelling. However, analysing real corporate platforms introduced complexity: I felt a bit disappointed in how even top airlines have limitations. Surprising when entire teams are dedicated to a robust website.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Positive: Ryanair’s brand identity was strong, with colour schemes resonating well with its logo. Effort can be put into every detail.  Negative: EasyJet’s website brought irritation. Ryanair’s was not perfect either. All explained in my initial post you can view below. </li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Drawing on visual design principles, my critiques are harsh and based off what I have learnt only recently. But this gave me an opportunity to look deeper into design of everyday user interfaces. </li>
											<li><b>Conclusion: </b> The unit was another opportunity to use what we have learned in the real world. Looking back now, I may have been a bit harsh and not taken into account the difficulty of the ‘perfect website’. Next time I would like to list how difficult it would be to get all user feedback to make the perfect website</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan: </b> Take into consideration the main objective of a dashboard instead of trying to please everyone. As everyone will have an opinion. This will allow me to create better dashboards.</li>

												&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 3: Peer Feedback (Reviewing and Being Reviewed)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I analysed my peers initial posts on Ryanair and EasyJet and gave feedback. The feedback I received was I need to emphasize more on some of my points like how I stated EasyJet’s “cramped” map affected navigation.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I appreciated the chance to compare experiences and gather multiple perspectives. I learnt, again, something I notice in many of my modules that I need to emphasize more on certain points. Something I believe is getting better but is defiantly my weak point.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Positive: I was commended for my insightful analysis by one of my peers. Who fully agreed with my analysis throughout. Negative: I was not thrilled to only receive two reviews, I would have liked more interaction from peers and the lecturer.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Peer feedback is always great. I am able to compare projects directly while noting where I can see improvements and receive the same thing back. This gives me a great opportunity to understand the thought process of other learners.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion: </b> I have again learnt that I need to work on my emphasis in my reporting. Strengthen my argument. Next time I will ask myself if a reviewer will have any questions on what I just wrote, if so, good chance I need to emphasise more on it.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan: </b> Actively find where I can emphasise more on points I have made in future reports.</li>
												&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 4: Summary Post from Feedback</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> I wrote the summary post, based on the initial post I wrote and the feedback I was given. The central theme was that no site is flawless, and user testing is key.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I took a more positive approach. Feeling more like the team leader giving feedback than a critic judging every bad detail.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Positive: Peer review pushed me to write better and emphasise more. Negative: I would like less reporting and more practical coding now. </li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Covering a report over three units feels a bit dragged. But it followed a great course to improve report writing. Great way to prepare us for the assignment coming in unit 8.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion: </b> I learnt more about my own writing and my judgement. In future I will take more care in expecting perfection.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan: </b> Ask why, instead of saying something is wrong with peers and my employees in the future.</li>

												&nbsp;

										<h3>Units 5–7: R Refresher and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> These units I worked on basics to advanced coding in R. Practicing EDA (Exploratory Data Analytics) tasks like summarizing distributions, spotting missing values, and crafting multi-layered plots.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I enjoyed the refresher. Though I am proficient in Python, I spent around 2 years working with R a few years ago in my undergrade. </li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Positive: R came back to me like I never stopped. I enjoyed the tasks we had to do. Negative: Though I enjoyed R. I would of liked the option to do it all in Python. My preferred language.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> The units showed me the EDA process is generally the same. But every time you run into different issues with cleaning and deciding what stays and what goes. Though that is my favourite part of analytics, so no complaints there. </li>
											<li><b>Conclusion: </b> I got caught up in R again and I got significant practice in the EDA process. I would of liked more complex EDA tasks. Messier data to play with.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan: </b> Dive deep into the EDA process. Make sure the data is spotless and I fully understand it. </li>
												&nbsp;
