										<center><p style="color: black;">Intelligent assistants like Alexa and Siri, image searches that found the topic of a photo, and self-driving cars â€“ these intelligent systems used machine learning to develop 
											their expertise. In this module, I learned about various machine learning techniques but concentrated on deep neural learning. I learned about the underlying theory and got hands-on experience creating, 
											training, evaluating, and using machine learning systems. I also examined how these technologies were used and misused and what that meant for our societies and communities.</p></center>
