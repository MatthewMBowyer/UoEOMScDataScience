											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">My e‑portfolio tells the story of my journey through
												my latest module, Machine Learning. Every unit is broken down with 
											Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (The University of Edinburgh, 2024), and I finish with a big‑picture reflection that also borrows 
											the “What? So what? Now what?” steps from Rolfe et al. (2001). Walland & Shaw (2020) 
											go on and tell us that an e‑portfolio is both process and product, so you’ll see my messy 
											thinking as well as my polished results.</p>
											
										<section>
											<header>
												<h2>Reflection Approach: Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">Why Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle? Because it is well rounded and has successfully helped me through several modules now. The cycle involves six key steps:</p>
											<li><b>Description:</b> on the learning experience throughout each unit in the module.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> on my emotional response to initially viewing the units and then feedback on the complete projects.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> of the entire unit, the good and the bad.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> on the units in hindsight.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> on the unit and what I have learned and what I would have done differently.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> on how I would deal with the next unit or module.</li>
												&nbsp;
											<p style="color: black;">Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle keeps me honest: I describe, feel, 
												evaluate, analyse, conclude, action‑plan – no corners cut throughout each unit.
											
											</p>

												<h2>Reflection on Each Unit</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Compared ML with stats models in the Lecturecast; wrote a discussion post on the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Hungarian GP IT outage.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Finally a module directly aligned with my professional interests</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Used the discussion post as a reason to talk about F1. Great reason to finally look deeper into what happened Hungarian GP 2024</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Machine learning (ML) lives inside bigger, human‑centred systems. When the GP timing screens died, nobody cared about fancy models – they cared about fallback plans.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Tech should augment human judgment, not try replace it. Echoes Industry 5.0 thinking.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Started backing up all my code and organized my coworkers access to the code on critical reporting and dashboard applications.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>collaboration discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											
												&nbsp;
											<h3>Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Revised EDA steps and received a peer review on my collaboration discussion.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Confident, the last module we worked extensively on EDAs and i received a distinction.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Peer feedback reminded me to emphasize action plans and fallbacks for when issues like Hungarian GP 2024 happen.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Transparent EDA underpins fallbacks and "what if it does not work".</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Negatives can strengthen the positives. Dont ignore them.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Focus more on potential fallbacks if EDA fails or assumptions are wrong during EDA process.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>collaboration discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 3 – Correlation & Regression</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Played with covariance, Pearson r, linear & polynomial fits; wrote my summary post.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> At first a bit overwhelmed by the raw mathematics and theory but once i saw the code it all clicked</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Used Python experiments to show variance.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Correlation drives prediction, but without stress‑tests it’s brittle.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Correlation and regression are great for prediction, but in real-world systems, knowing how and when they fail is just as important.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Automate “corrupt‑a‑copy” tests (shuffle labels, inject noise) before signing off any model.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>collaboration discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
											<li><b>linear and Polynomial regression:</b> Some examples of visuals from the python work in the unit. Predicting values using regression.</li>

											</div>

											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 4 – Linear Regression with Scikit‑Learn</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Refreshed uni‑ & multi‑variate regression in scikit‑learn; engine‑size vs emissions plot.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Simple revision. Basics</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Pretty basic unit. Enjoyed working with new types of data though.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> The right plot matters. When viewing data in a plot, try different plots.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Tools help, understanding wins.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Make sure you try all plots before assuming no correlation. Like a pairplot</li>
											<li><b>Example of linear regression using Scikit‑Learn:</b> Plot showing how emissions rise with engine size. </li>

											</div>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 5 – Clustering</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Learnt about clustering techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Did exercises with new types of data using the Jaccard coefficient.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Found the unfamiliar datasets both engaging and intellectually stimulating. – stretched my pattern‑spotting.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Good: Picked the correct metrics. Bad: Data was not as clean as i thought it was.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Clusters without domain context can mislead – “pretty blobs” aren’t insights.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Understand domain context first, always</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Chat to execs, managers etc for domain context first.</li>
											<li><a href="https://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/6.html" target="_blank"><b>Visual representation of how k-means clustering works visually</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 6 – Clustering with Python (Team Project)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Built EDA & core code for NYC Airbnb “quiet neighbourhood” recommender with experienced teamate; teammates wrote report.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I really enjoyed the programming and the collaboration. I was not as present for the reporting side of the project due to focusing on the coding. Missed a good opportunity to improve my reporting.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Proud of the work i handed in. Great team put it all together in a report.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Great idea and code from my side. Needed to make more time to work with other half of team on reporting.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Take more opportunities to learn.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Keep in contact with team. Learn from the guys who wrote the distinction worth report.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Group TM3 - Business Analysis Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 6 Group Project</b></a></li>

											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 7 – Intro to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Dug into perceptrons, AND/OR gates, delta rule.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Theory‑heavy, itching to code.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I remember learning about how ANNs are based off of human brains. Still as facinating to see it now.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Understanding the logic behind how ANNs work help explain the issue of black box coding.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Remember to dive into the logic more often, no matter how theory-heavy. It is always worth it.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Get back to writing papers. Write a basic paper on ANNs after the module.</li>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 8 – Training an ANN</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Python exercise on learning‑rate vs iterations</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Relief to code again; Disappointed by my lack of participation in the second collaboration discussion forum due to time constraints this module.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Great little project on the importance of too many and too few iterations.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Iteration counts = cost; law/ethics = reputational cost – both must be optimised.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Performance is multi‑objective.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Build a tiny “ethics validator” which i will now into future demos. Which i found in one of my peers collaboration discussions.</li>
											<li><b>Cost (error) vs iterations:</b> Visual on how you can miss the lowest point and have high error with low iteration. Though too many iterations is a waste of time.</li>
											<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 24px;">

											</div>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 9 – Intro to CNNs</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> CIFAR‑10 baseline, 80 %+ accuracy; explored cnn‑explainer visual.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Excited by the opportunity to revisit CNNs</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I dont work with CNNs enough. Would like to do more. Many real world use cases for it, like at my tracking company. Image recognition can assist with tracking stolen vehicles.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Need to find more time to do this at work. Might write my unit 11 project on CNNs and present to execs at work.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Build more CNNs. See how far you can take them</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Plan to build and write reports on CNNs.</li>
											<li><a href="https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/" target="_blank"><b>My favourite visual on CNNs methodology</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 10 – Natural Language Processing</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Theory sprint on transformers, BLEU/ROUGE; no code task.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Was hoping for more on this as it is the big rave in AI right now.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Took good notes.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Visual aids and a python project can strengthen this module.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Need self-set mini projects and research before moving onto next module.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Fine tuned a small ollama project for my company over the weekend.</li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 11 – Model Selection & Evaluation (Presentation)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Built improved CNN for dash‑cam objects; made a 20‑min exec presentation</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Nerves → adrenaline → success. Project was a big one, presenting is not yet a natural skill. I need to work on it.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Slides were built very well. Research was thorough Worried nerves show in slide show.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Presenting to non‑tech execs = balancing act between rigour and clarity – my Achilles heel.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Reporting still the gap (déjà vu from last module). But definitely better</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Show reports to my partner before going live. Seems to have worked this time. Waiting for marks.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 Transcript.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 11 project transcript</b></a></li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 Slide Final.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 11 project detailed slideshow</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 12 – Industry 4.0 & ML</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Deepfakes, digital twins, job prospects; explored DALL‑E images.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Insightful, with some ethically concerning implications.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Good synthesis with Unit 1 discussions.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Industry 5.0 will judge ML on trust as much as accuracy.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Stay curious, stay ethical.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Remember anything you build can be used for all the wrong reasons.</li>

											<h4 style="color: black;">What? Summary of journey</h4>
												<p style="color: black;">Twelve units later and I have taken another step in my algorithm 
													skills, but just as importantly, I have seen where I still need to learn. The module 
													felt familiar, as I have several years of experience in Machine Learning. Though the 
													module brought new ideas to the table that I have not dived deep enough into 
													throughout my career.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">I am proud of what I delivered. From investigating and 
														reporting on a famous IT outage to building my first practical CNN project for 
														a company I work for. I have learnt a lot this module. Each module introduced 
														me to insights into neural networks I had yet to discover. Though I do need to 
														dive deeper into large language models (LLM) and transformers myself. I have more confidence with machine learning 
														than before, and now I know the importance of taking ethics and communication 
														into account.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">As Walland & Shaw (2020) insist, an e‑portfolio is about the 
														process behind the artefacts. So, the real story sits in the invisible layers: 
														late‑night debugging, bad ping, “A‑ha!” moments when domain context finally clicks, 
														and that performance anxiety during live presentations.</p>

											<h4 style="color: black;">So what? Digging into growth, pain points, and patterns</h4>

<h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Key Insights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1. My default mental model is build first, narrate later. Will work on domain context first.</li>
  <li>2. Ethics and resilience need to be taken into account. Important i see likely hood of my project failing and who it may affect.</li>
  <li>3. Live presentations are my new bottleneck. Though my storytelling still needs work, live presenting gives me a lot of nerves.</li>
</ul>

													<h4 style="color: black;">Conclusion</h4>
													<p style="color: black;">I started the module feeling like “This is my domain, machine learning is my day job.” Halfway in I realized I have not been emphasising resilience and ethics. By Unit 11, before presenting to execs, I felt the weight of translation: code alone won’t move the needle; stories do.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">Am I satisfied? Mostly. My technical bar rose; my communication bar nudged upward, my ethics bar has begun to grow. But i still have a long way to go. Reflections are only as good as action. I have added all actions to my to do list and I will complete them.</p>
