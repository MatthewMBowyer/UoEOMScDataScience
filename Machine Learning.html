											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<p style="color: black;">My e‑portfolio tells the story of my journey through
												my latest module, Machine Learning. Every unit is broken down with 
											Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (The University of Edinburgh, 2024), and I finish with a big‑picture reflection that also borrows 
											the “What? So what? Now what?” steps from Rolfe et al. (2001). Walland & Shaw (2020) 
											go on and tell us that an e‑portfolio is both process and product, so you’ll see my messy 
											thinking as well as my polished results.</p>
											
										<section>

												<h2>Reflection Approach: Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle</h2>
											</header>
											<p style="color: black;">Why Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle? Because it is well rounded and has successfully helped me through several mdoules now. The cycle involves six key steps:</p>
											<li><b>Description:</b> on the learning experience throughout each unit in the module.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> on my emotional response to initially viewing the units and then feedback on the complete projects.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> of the entire unit, the good and the bad.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> on the units in hindsight.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> on the unit and what I have learned and what I would have done differently.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> on how I would deal with the next unit or module.</li>
												&nbsp;
											<p style="color: black;">Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle keeps me honest: I describe, feel, 
												evaluate, analyse, conclude, action‑plan – no corners cut throughout each unit.

												<h2>Reflection on Each Unit</h2>
											</header>

											<h3>Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Compared ML with stats models in the Lecturecast; wrote a discussion post on the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Hungarian GP IT outage.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Finally a module directly relating to what i do and love to do!</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Used the discussion post as a reason to talk about F1. Great reason to finally look deeper into what happend Hungarian GP 2024</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Machine learning (ML) lives inside bigger, human‑centred systems. When the GP timing screens died, nobody cared about fancy models – they cared about fallback plans.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Tech should augment human judgment, not try replace it. Echoes Industry 5.0 thinking.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Started backing up all my code and organized my coworkers access to the code on critical reporting and dashboard applications.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Colab discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											
												&nbsp;
											<h3>Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Revised EDA steps and received a peer review on my collaboration discussion.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Confident, the last module we worked extensively on EDA's and i received a distinction.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Peer feedback reminded me to emphasize action plans and fallbacks for when issues like Hungarian GP 2024 happen.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Transparent EDA underpins fallbacks and "what if it doesnt work".</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Negatives can strength the positives. Dont ignore them.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Focus more on potential fallbacks if EDA fails or assumptions are wrong during EDA process.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Colab discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 3 – Correlation & Regression</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Played with covariance, Pearson r, linear & polynomial fits; wrote my summary post.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> At first a bit overwhelmed by the raw mathematics and theory but once i saw the code it all clicked</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Used Python experiments to show variance.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Correlation drives prediction, but without stress‑tests it’s brittle.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Correlation and regression are great for prediction, but in real-world systems, knowing how and when they fail is just as important.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Automate “corrupt‑a‑copy” tests (shuffle labels, inject noise) before signing off any model.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 1 - Colab discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Colab discussion Unit 1-3</b></a></li>
											<li><b>linear and Polynomial regression:</b> Some examples of visuals from the python work in the unit. Predicting values using regression.</li>

  											<img src="images/Unit 3 Poly Predictor.png" style="width: 45%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">
											</div>

											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 4 – Linear Regression with Scikit‑Learn</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Refreshed uni‑ & multi‑variate regression in scikit‑learn; engine‑size vs emissions plot.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Simple revision. Basics</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Pretty basic unit. Enjoyed working with new types of data though.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> The right plot matters. When viewing data in a plot, try different plots.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Tools help, understanding wins.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Make sure you try all plots before assuming no correlation. Like a pairplot</li>
											<li><b>Example of linear regression using Scikit‑Learn:</b> Plot showing how emissions rise with engine size. </li>

											</div>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 5 – Clustering</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Learnt about clustering techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Did exercises with new types of data using the Jaccard coefficient.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Loved the unfamiliar datasets – stretched my pattern‑spotting.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Good: Picked the correct metrics. Bad: Data was not as clean as i thought it was.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Clusters without domain context can mislead – “pretty blobs” aren’t insights.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Understand domain context first, always</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Chat to execs, managers etc for domain context first.</li>
											<li><a href="https://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/6.html" target="_blank"><b>Visual representation of how k-means clustering works visually</b></a></li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 6 – Clustering with Python (Team Project)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Built EDA & core code for NYC Airbnb “quiet neighbourhood” recommender with expereinced teamate; teammates wrote report.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> I really enjoyed the programming and the collaboration. I was not as present for the reporting side of the project due to focusing on the coding. Missed a good opportunity to improve my reporting.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Proud of the work i handed in. Great team put it all together in a report.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Great idea and code from my side. Needed to make more time to work with other half of team on reporting.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Take more opportunities to learn.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Keep in contact with team. Learn from the guys who wrote the distinction worth report.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Group TM3 - Business Analysis Report.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 6 Group Project</b></a></li>

											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 7 – Intro to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Dug into perceptrons, AND/OR gates, delta rule.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Theory‑heavy, itching to code.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I remember learning about how ANNs are based off of human brains. Still as facinating to see it now.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Understanding the logic behind how ANNs work help explain the issue of black box coding.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Remember to dive into the logic more often, no matter how theory-heavy. It is always worth it.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Get back to writing papers. Write a basic paper on ANNs after the module.</li>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 8 – Training an ANN</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Python exercise on learning‑rate vs iterations</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Relief to code again; annoyance at myself for skipping the second colab discussion forum due to time constraints this module.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Great little project on the importance of too many and too few iterations.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Iteration counts = cost; law/ethics = reputational cost – both must be optimised.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Performance is multi‑objective.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Build a tiny “ethics validator” stub (thanks Mohammed who wrote on this in the colab discussion) into future demos.</li>
											<li><b>Cost (error) vs iterations:</b> Visual on how you can miss the lowest point and have high error with low iteration. Though too many iterations is a waste of time.</li>
											<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 24px;">
  											<img src="images/Unit 8 Costs vs iterations.png" alt="Project highlight" style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">
											</div>
											&nbsp;

										<h3>Unit 9 – Intro to CNNs</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> CIFAR‑10 baseline, 80 %+ accuracy; explored cnn‑explainer visual.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Stoked – love image work.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> I dont work with CNNs enough. Would like to do more. Many real world use cases for it, like at my tracking company. Image recognition can assist with tracking stolen vehicles.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Need to find more time to do this at work. Might write my unit 11 project on CNNs and present to execs at work.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Build more CNNs. See how far you can take them</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Plan to build and write reports on CNNs.</li>
											<li><a href="https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/" target="_blank"><b>My favourite visual on CNNs methodology</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 10 – Natural Language Processing</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Theory sprint on transformers, BLEU/ROUGE; no code task.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Was hoping for more on this as it is the big rave in AI right now.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Took good notes.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Visual aids and a python project can stregthen this module.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Need self-set mini projects and research before mvoing onto next module.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Fine tuned a small ollama project for my company over the weekend.</li>
											&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 11 – Model Selection & Evaluation (Presentation)</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Built improved CNN for dash‑cam objects; made a 20‑min exec presentation</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Nerves → adrenaline → success. Project was a big one, presenting is not yet a natural skill. I need to work on it.</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Slides were built very well. Research was thoughrough. Worried nerves show in slide show.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Presenting to non‑tech execs = balancing act between rigour and clarity – my Achilles heel.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Reporting still the gap (déjà vu from last module). But defiently better</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Show reports to past the misses before going live. Seems to have worked this time. Waiting for marks.</li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 Transcript.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 11 project transcript</b></a></li>
											<li><a href="assets/Unit 11 Slide Final.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Unit 11 project detailed slideshow</b></a></li>
												&nbsp;

											<h3>Unit 12 – Industry 4.0 & ML</h3>
											<li><b>Description:</b> Deepfakes, digital twins, job prospects; explored DALL‑E images.</li>
											<li><b>Feelings:</b> Eye‑opening (and a bit creepy).</li>
											<li><b>Evaluation:</b> Good synthesis with Unit 1 discussions.</li>
											<li><b>Analysis:</b> Industry 5.0 will judge ML on trust as much as accuracy.</li>
											<li><b>Conclusion:</b> Stay curious, stay ethical.</li>
											<li><b>Action Plan:</b> Remember anything you build can be used for all the wrong reasons.</li>

											<p style="color: black;"><b>What? Summary of journey</b></p>
												<p style="color: black;">Twelve units later and I have taken another step in my algorithm 
													skills, but just as importantly, I have seen where I still need to learn. The module 
													felt familiar, as I have several years of experience in Machine Learning. Though the 
													module brought new ideas to the table that I have not dived deep enough into 
													throughout my career.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">I am proud of what I delivered. From investigating and 
														reporting on a famous IT outage to building my first practical CNN project for 
														a company I work for. I have learnt a lot this module. Each module introduced 
														me to insights into neural networks I had yet to discover. Though I do need to 
														dive deeper into large langauge models (LLM) and transformers myself. I have more confidence with machine learning 
														than before, and now I know the importance of taking ethics and communication 
														into account.</p>
													<p style="color: black;">As Walland & Shaw (2020) insist, an e‑portfolio is about the 
														process behind the artefacts. So, the real story sits in the invisible layers: 
														late‑night debugging, bad ping, “A‑ha!” moments when domain context finally clicks, 
														and that shy panic during live presentations.</p>

											<p style="color: black;"><b>So what? Digging into growth, pain points, and patterns</b></p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Key Insights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1. My default mental model is build first, narrate later. Will work on domain context first.</li>
  <li>2. Ethics and resilience needs to be taken into account. Important i see likely hood of my project failing and who it may affect.</li>
  <li>3. Live presentations are my new bottleneck. Though my story telling still needs work, live presenting gives me a lot of nerves.</li>

													<p style="color: black;"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
													<p style="color: black;">Looking back, this module wasn’t just about building charts, it was about learning to think, write, and reflect like a professional. 
														The process wasn’t always fun, but it was always valuable. Reflection has helped me recognise my strengths (technical problem-solving, persistence) 
														and identify areas I’m working on (reporting with impact, theoretical grounding). I’ll take this forward not just in future academic modules, 
														but in my career as a Data Scientist, where the ability to explain, visualise, and justify decisions is just as important as writing clean code. 
														If anything, this module helped me bridge that gap. Like The University of Edinburgh (2024) suggests, reflection is cyclical. And as I close this 
														module, I’m already thinking about the next project where I’ll apply everything I’ve learnt, stronger, more aware, and more confident in my growth.</p>
